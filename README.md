# Real-Time Alert Dashboard Simulator

The Real-Time Alert Dashboard is a web application built using React, TypeScript, and Chakra UI. It demonstrates the implementation of real-time communication with WebSocket via socket.io, enabling users to receive and manage alerts instantly. The application is designed with a focus on real-time functionality, leveraging React 18's features for a responsive and efficient user experience. Currently, it utilizes a context-based state management approach to handle application state. Plans to incorporate client-side routing with React Router for enhanced navigation are underway. The use of Chakra UI ensures an accessible and modern interface, facilitating user interaction with the alert system.

TODOs:

1. fill out readme later with the set up instructions and other details
2. react routing to separate form and active alerts
